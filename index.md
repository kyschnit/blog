#### what is this? where am i? who are you?

all valid questions. this is a blog. my name is Kyle Schnitzer. you likely got here from my
main website which talks all about me, so i'll spare you the long introduction.
what you should know is that i am a software engineer from michigan and i like the outdoors.
if you really want to know more you can go to my [main website](https://www.kyle-schnitzer.com).\
\
i've always liked the idea of writing, but i've felt discouraged by all the constraints
put on the written work i've had to produce for classes and jobs. this is an experiment
to see if i really do like writing without all the limitations and structure.\
\
all opinions on this site are my own.
